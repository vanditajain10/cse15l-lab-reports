# CSE 15 L Week 1 Lab Report 

**1. cd Command**
![Image](cd command.jpeg)

* Example with no arguments can be seen in the first command line. The working directory when the command was running was home directory. The output can be interpreted as the directory getting changed back to the home directory since we have provided no commands. No error is observed in output.
  
* Example with path to directory can be seen in the second command line. The working directory now gets changed from home to 'lecture 1'after the command runs. The output that we have observed from this is that the directory gets changed and now becomes 'lecture 1'. No error is observed in output.

* Example with path to file can be seen in the third command line. There is no change in the working directory now and it is 'lecture 1' only because we had changed that in the previous commnad. The output can hece be seen as an an error because with cd command we need a directory only to change the directory from one to another but the change from a directory to a file is not possible which can also be seen in the output.
